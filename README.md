# Kittens Rise Up Game Client
## About
A mmorpg with a heavy focus on resource management and long term progression.

Gameplay will look something like the following..
- Login to central game server where everyone will connect
- Choose a location on a 2D tile map where your civilization will go
- See where other people chose to put their civilizations on different tiles
- Purchase several structures from the server which will generate resource / s
- Click on other players civs on the map, choose to trade or battle with them
- Battles are instant text based battles (perhaps this will become something more interesting in the future, for e.g. AoE RTS style battles with still keeping the option to auto evaulate the battle results instantly in case someone doesn't want to start a long RTS battle)
